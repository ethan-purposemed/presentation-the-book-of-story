## What is Storybook?

> Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It's open source and free.

## Pretty good support

## Main concepts

## Stories

Captures rendered state of a UI component. Components can be a collection of stories where each story is a different state of that component.

## Docs

Storybook is able to analyze your components and automatically generate documentation for them.

## Testing

When we make components we make stories, but we also need to test them. You can write tests for your stories and they will be run in Storybook with pretty low-effort.

## Sharing

We're able to publish our stories to expose your work with others either internally or publicly. Additionally, you can showcase your stories in apps like Notion and even Figma!

## Why do we need this thing?

## The web landscape changing

Overtime web has become more complex and component-driven tools have become a great way to break down really complex interfaces into smaller, more manageable pieces. These UI components can be difficult to test due to being tangled up with the rest of the application logic.

## Component driven development

By leveraging Storybook we can build in isolation which is a benefit for both developers, designers, and testers. Developer especially benefits from this as it allows them to focus on the component and not the rest of the application and actually is a good way to right components that are easy to test and not tied to any external dependencies.
